# FlickrApp

Application using the Flickr Api to search images based on user search querys if the image's tag contans the query. 
UIKit was used for this application with all elements native in MVVM architecture.

### Improvements
Some improvements ere are to definitely add more Unit tests and UI tests.
Cater a bit more to landscape mode, as it only does on the main screen.
Better search caching to not have as many requests.
